## Slide In Presentation Action:
- The presented controller will take up two-thirds of the screen and the remaining third will show as dimmed. To dismiss the controller, you just tap on the dimmed portion.
- take care of three critical pieces: 
    - subclass
    - dimming view 
    - customizing the transition

## Custom Presentation Implementing Structure
- MainViewController.swift
    - override prepare(for segue:) 
        - Assigning custom transitioning delegate to the presented view controller's transitioningDelegate

- SlideInPresentationController.swift
    - PresentationController Class
        - Defining custom presentation process
            - Defining Custom PresentationController's init()
            - Overriding presentationTransitionWillBegin() 
            - Overriding dismissalTransitionWillBegin()
            - Overriding containerViewWillLayoutSubviews()
                - presentedView?.frame = frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView
                    - To reset the presented viewâ€™s frame to fit any changes to the containerView frame.
            - Overriding size(forChildContentContainer: )
                - To give the size of the presented view controller's content
            - Overriding frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView property 
                - to return the full frame of presented view

- SlideInPresentationManager.swift
    - Setting presentation direction
    - To conform UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate protocol
        - //When you present a view controller using the UIModalPresentationStyle.custom presentation style, the system calls this method and asks for the presentation controller that manages your custom style. If you implement this method, use it to create and return the custom presentation controller object that you want to use to manage the presentation process.
            - presentationController(forPresented: presenting: source: ) 
                - //Here you instantiate a SlideInPresentationController with the direction from SlideInPresentationManager
